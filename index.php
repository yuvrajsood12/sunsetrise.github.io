                <p>The first verifiable claim for a practically used bicycle belongs to <span style="font-weight: bold;">German Baron Karl von Drais</span>, a civil servant to the Grand Duke of Baden in Germany. Drais invented his Laufmaschine (German for
                    "running machine") in 1817, that was called Draisine (English) or draisienne (French) by the press. Karl von Drais patented this design in 1818, which was the first commercially successful two-wheeled, steerable, human-propelled machine,
                    commonly called a velocipede, and nicknamed hobby-horse or dandy horse. It was initially manufactured in Germany and France.</p>
                <p>Hans-Erhard Lessing (Drais's biographer) found from circumstantial evidence that Drais's interest in finding an alternative to the horse was the starvation and death of horses caused by crop failure in 1816, the Year Without a Summer (following
                    the volcanic eruption of Tambora in 1815).</p>
                <p>On his first reported ride from Mannheim on June 12, 1817, he covered 13 km (eight miles) in less than an hour.[11] Constructed almost entirely of wood, the draisine weighed 22 kg (48 pounds), had brass bushings within the wheel bearings,
                    iron shod wheels, a rear-wheel brake and 152 mm (6 inches) of trail of the front-wheel for a self-centering caster effect. This design was welcomed by mechanically minded men daring to balance, and several thousand copies were built
                    and used, primarily in Western Europe and in North America. Its popularity rapidly faded when, partly due to increasing numbers of accidents, some city authorities began to prohibit its use. However, in 1866 Paris a Chinese visitor
                    named Bin Chun could still observe foot-pushed velocipedes.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;background-color:black;color:white;">ROAD BIKES</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 100px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Road bikes</span> are best identified by their drop or turned-down handlebars and skinny tires. The downward-curving handlebars are usually super lightweight that help put you in an aerodynamic position.
                    The lightweight frame makes this type of bicycle particularly good for numerous pavement uses including racing, touring, fitness riding, long-distance rides and daily commuting.</p>
                <p>The large, thin tires allow you to glide the bike along various terrains with zero to little effort. If you are supremely concerned about speed, varied options for hand and riding positions, and an efficient transference of energy into
                    propelling the bike forward, a road bike is the best option for you.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;background-color:black;color:white;">MOUNTAIN BIKE</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 80px;">This bike is designed with excellent braking systems and shock-absorbing features that can easily handle serious bumps, rocks, dirt trails, roots and ruts. Mountain bikes are meant for dealing with steeper terrain which is why most of
                    them consist of lower gears as compared to most other road bikes.</p>
                <p>They usually have 26-inch or 29-inch wide knobby tires that make them function amazingly well over obstacles and in loose dirt. They also consist of rugged components and frames, flat handlebars and suspension in order to assist cyclists
                    in navigating rocky mountain hills.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;background-color:black;color:white;">TOURING BIKE</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">These are almost like the traditional road bikes, except with a few tweaks and changes that make them perfect for long-distance bike tours. Touring bikes come with multiple attachment points with the help of which you can attach fenders,
                    pumps, lights, racks, water bottles and so much more. They also contain super sturdy frames that allow them to carry heavy loads on both the front and the rear racks.</p>
                <p>You must have noticed that in many touring bikes come with a longer wheelbase, which is specially engineered to provide more control to the rider, owing to their lower center of gravity. Majority of touring bikes also consist of disc brakes
                    that provide them with enhanced stopping power, particularly on non-paved surfaces. A defining feature of touring bikes is their wide or semi-knobby tires that are especially designed to handle gravel roads.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 100px;">a curved strip or cover over a wheel of a vehicle, especially a bicycle or motorcycle, designed to protect the vehicle and rider from water and dirt thrown up from the road.</p>
                <p>Mud guards are used to stop mud, water and gravel that becomes unstuck to the surface of the tire, flies off and travels in a straight line. The mud guard stops the flying mud from making a mess and flying rocks from causing damage to
                    the vehicle or other vehicles....</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 80px;">Seat covers and cushions for bicycles can fulfil several functions. They can protect your bicycle saddle from the weather. They can stop a damaged bicycle seat from enduring further wear and tear. They can keep your bottom dry. And perhaps
                    most importantly: they can make an uncomfortable ride much more comfortable!</p>
